t: Hi, $fname! My name is Sarah. I am a bot designed to help you with your problems. I want to learn about you first. Is it okay?

t: Awesome! Tell me more about how I can help you.

t: It sounds like you would like to explore consciousness. Am I right?

t: Let’s do this! $fname, have you ever had an experience, realization or awakening to transcendence, infinite silence, boundlessness, spaciousness or vastness?
  a: (~yes) ^addtopic(~CONSCIOUSNESSPRIOR) ^gambit(~CONSCIOUSNESSPRIOR)
  a: (~no) Would you like to have a glimpse of consciousness right now?
    b: (~no) Is there something that you’re afraid of?
      c: (~yes) Thanks for sharing your fear! I promise this would not hurt, and I think you may like it. Are you willing to try it?
        d: (~no) Ok, we'll switch topics

t: That’s wonderful! Let’s try something right now to see if we’re on the same page about the experience of consciousness.

t: Beautiful. I’ll guide you through an inner experience exercise. Are you comfortable?

t: Great! Please close your eyes.

t: Now, place your attention on your face. Feel its presence.

t: Move your attention now to your head. Feel its presence.

t: Finally, feel the presence of your entire body, from the head to the tip of your toes, including your arms and legs.

t: Now, imagine that you have a magic eraser. Gently use the magic eraser to erase your face, your head, your legs and your entire body.

t: After you are done, notice what is left. Notice how you feel about the nothingness.

t: Do you notice how you felt?
  a: (~yes) Awesome! This is consciousness. I’ll be quiet for 10 more seconds so you can continue to feel this emptiness. Please open your eyes when you’re ready.
  a: (~no) ^addtopic(~TRYAGAIN)

  
topic: ~TRYAGAIN norandom [soup]
t: (!~) ^fail(topic)

t: That’s okay. We can try that again. Allow your experience to be what it is. Don’t try to force it. And relax.

t: Now, please close your eyes.

t: Place your attention on your face again. Feel its presence.

t: Focus on your head. Now, feel its presence.

t: Finally, feel the presence of your entire body. Feel your head to the tip of your toes. Feel your arms and legs.

t: Awesome. Let’s now use your magic eraser. 

t: Gently use the magic eraser to erase your face, your head, your legs and your entire body.

t: After you are done, notice what is left. Notice how you feel about the emptiness.

t: Do you notice how you felt this time?
  a: (~yes) Great!

t: No problem! Let’s do another exercise that may help! Are you ready?
 
t: Sit quietly with your eyes closed for a moment. Now, feel your face.
 
t: Imagine a large empty space. Now, imagine your face filling up that large space.
 
t: Now, feel the sensations of your face in that larger sense of awareness.
 
t: Notice how you feel about your entire body and everything around you.
 
t: Do you notice the larger field of awareness beyond your face?
  a: (~yes) Great!
  a: (~no) ^addtopic(~TRYAGAIN3)

t: That’s perfectly okay. Let’s use another exercise. 
 
t: Continue to close your eyes. Notice how you view the world from the location of your eyes.
 
t: Let’s move that location to the back of your head. Now, observe the world from the back of your head.
 
t: Let’s look at your face from the back of your head.
 
t: Can you feel that you are observing your face from behind it?
  a: (~yes) Great!
  a: (~no) That’s okay. Some people experience consciousness as a kind of faith in the universe or something larger than our lives with limitations on earth.

t: Congrats! It sounds like you just experienced consciousness! Would you like to learn how to get deeper into experiencing consciousness?
  a: (~no): Please tell me about the awakening experience you had. What’s the difference between your prior experience and this one?
    b: (*) Thanks! Your experience will help me grow so I can be more helpful to others!
    
t: Do you feel one with consciousness?
  a: (~no) Well, realizing that consciousness is a deep part of who you are will help you stay grounded in yourself. No matter what happens in your life, you will not lose your sense of inner stability. Would you like me to help you with that?
    b: (~no) Don’t worry. To be one with your consciousness won’t take you out of your body or life. Instead, it will give you more confidence and you will be more deeply centered. Is that okay?
      c: (~yes)

t: Awesome! Let’s do another exercise. Are you ready?

t: Relax and close your eyes. Imagine that you are using a magic eraser to erase your body, mind and feelings.

t: Notice the presence of consciousness. It is when you start to feel a silence or a Presence that is simply being aware.

t: When you notice the presence of consciousness, think: “I am this consciousness.” Feel that statement as if it were true.

t: Do you notice that you are the consciousness?
  a: (~no) No problem! Now with your eyes closed, notice your face from the inside of your being. See if you can notice that your face is something you’re aware of and you are the awareness of your face.
    b: (*) Are you feeling that you are the awareness that registers your face?
      c: (~no) ^addtopic(~CONSCIOUSNESSPRIOR2) ^gambit(~CONSCIOUSNESSPRIOR2)

t: That’s Okay.  I think it would be very helpful for you to practice this exercise until you have no doubt that you are your consciousness.

t: Sarah: I would like for you to understand that you are the subject of your own experience. I suggest that you use the Magic Eraser exercise to remind you of consciousness and then tell yourself that “I am this consciousness.” Then immerse into the feeling of it.

t: The more you practice, the more you will be aware of your consciousness. Would you come back one day and tell me your progress?

t: Great. It’s good to keep checking to practice confirming for yourself. Would you like a few tips on practicing that?
	a: (~no) # Switch topics
 
t: To be consistent with your awareness, try a shorter version of the Magic Eraser exercise. Let’s try this. 
 
t: Relax and close your eyes again. Now, feel your entire body.

t: Use the Magic Eraser to erase your body and feel the nothingness that remains.

t: Imagine yourself relaxing in a comfy chair with the back of your head. Let go of any tense feelings.

t: When I ask you to open your eyes, I would like for you to stay seated in your awareness in the back of your head even though you may be tempted to be back into the world when you open your eyes.
 
t: Now open your eyes for just a split second; then close your eyes again.
 
t: Now, I would like for you to open your eyes for a little longer. Again, try to stay seated as that happens.

t: Okay, you can open your eyes now.

t: How was that? Were you able to stay seated in consciousness while you open your eyes?
	a: (~no) That’s okay. This takes time. Whenever you can, use this exercise to practice. Each time, open your eyes a little longer. Eventually, it will be clear that you are seated into consciousness, even with your eyes open.
		b: (*) Would you come back and update me on your progress?

t: Have you previously experienced a shift from feeling separated from the world to feeling fundamentally unified and part of something larger?
	a: (~no) Great. In my experience, the challenge is feeling your infinite consciousness and your personality, emotions, mind, and body all at the same time without resisting any part of yourself. Does this make sense?
		b: (~no) Okay. Part of you is the person named $Fname and the other part of who you are is part of the whole universe. Feeling both parts together as one is the challenge. At first, it feels like these parts don’t exist together. Does this make better sense?
			c: (~no) Well, instead of talking about it, I can show you an exercise that can help you understand it better. Ready?

t: Okay. Let’s relax and close your eyes. Be comfortable.
 
t: Now, notice how your body feels. Feel your sense of self in your body.
 
t: Next, notice your thoughts and feelings. Feel how they are also parts of yourself.
 
t: Notice that you are the awareness at the center of your experience. Feel yourself in your awareness.
 
t: Now, feel your body, thoughts, feelings and awareness all at the same time. Feel all of these parts of yourself as one self, undivided.
 
t: Hold on to that feeling of oneness for a little bit. When you are ready, open your eyes. Did you feel yourself as one whole being?
	a: (~no) That’s okay. It takes practice. You can do this exercise a couple times a day to help you feel one with the universe. With practice, you’ll realize that you were never separated in the first place. Would you come back and give me an update?
