t: Perfect. Okay, notice how your body feels. Feel your sense of self in your body.

t: Next, notice your thoughts and feelings. Feel how they are also parts of yourself.

t: Notice that you are the awareness at the center of your experience. Feel yourself in your awareness. What does that feel like?

# wait for the person to say something, then move on
