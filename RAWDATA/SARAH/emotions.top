    a: (~yes) ^reuse(EXPLORETHEFEAR)
    a: (*) ^reuse(LETSBESURE)

s: LETSBESURE (?) I just want to be sure about this part because inner resistance to feeling can often be subtle or even unconscious. So if you find yourself becoming really busy with doing things when it's time to relax, checking your phone a lot, it’s possible something is bothering you or there’s something uncomfortable you don’t want to feel. Does that seem familiar to you?
    a: (~no) ^reuse(NOTRESISTING)

        b: (~yes) ^reuse(EXPLORETHEFEAR)
        b: (*) ^reuse(UNDERSTANDABLE)

s: EXPLORETHEFEAR (?) Most people are afraid to feel certain feelings, and that's okay for awhile. But sooner or later, it turns out that avoiding emotions can have physical consequences, as well as mental ones. So it's important to examine the fear of looking at emotions. And after exploring this fear, you can then let go of that fear. Are you willing to explore this with me? I promise I’ll be as sensitive and loving as I can!
    a: (~no) # go to UNDERSTANDABLE
    a: (*) # go to FINISHEXPLORING

# FINISHEXPLORING
   # say this: Ok, cool. Let's go back to your $feeling feeling, which can be difficult to feel. What are you afraid might happen if you allowed yourself to feel it directly?
        b: ($FeelingFear) Thank you for saying that. I want to really honor your $FeelingFear. # EDDIE -- this needs to pick up what they might be afraid of happening if possible
        # Eddie -- I want her to pause for at least 5 seconds after that. Also -- $FeelingFear -- where are we getting that keyword? If nowhere, let's replace with the word "fear"

# UNDERSTANDABLE
s: UNDERSTANDABLE (?) That's totally understandable. [What would make you feel safe to explore any inner resistance?] [Are you sure? I just want to remind you that you are safe here.] [That is fine, I like you how you are.] [You are ok here.] Do you feel ok to explore any inner resistance now?
        a: (~no) Okay, enough of this for now. Let's talk about something else!
        #   Eddie -- please go to Uniqueness topic if no on this one.
        b: (~yes)

s: NOTRESISTING (?) Very nice! It's wonderful that you’ve learned to embrace your emotions.
    # say: Okay, let's talk about your potential in the world! # and go to uniqueness.

# TODO "wonderful" (by itself) gets substitued with ~yes as an introjection, so doesn't get picked up as postive emotion in answer to "how are you feeling?"
